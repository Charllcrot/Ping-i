## Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Zenity

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
zenity --version
```

* If you see a version number, Zenity is already installed.
* If not, install it:

```bash
sudo apt update     # Optional but recommended
sudo apt install zenity
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install .NET SDK

Ping√ºi is written in C#, so the .NET SDK is required. Check if it‚Äôs installed:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

If not, install it (example for Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Download Ping√ºi

Clone the repository or download the source code:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build Ping√ºi

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

This generates the executable in:

```
bin/Release/net8.0/PinguiApp
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Ping√ºi

Run it with:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Or run the compiled binary directly:

```bash
./bin/Release/net8.0/PinguiApp
```
